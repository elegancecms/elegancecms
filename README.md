## 🧱 Architecture Overview

Elegance CMS is built on a hybrid architecture designed for performance, flexibility, and modern development standards:

- 🛠️ **Admin Panel:** Laravel Blade + Vue.js  
  A lightweight, proven backend experience with classic form handling and fast-rendering views.

- 🌐 **Frontend:** Laravel + Inertia.js + **React (with TypeScript / `.tsx`)**  
  A powerful, modern frontend structure using TypeScript for type safety and scalability — delivering SPA-like responsiveness with robust typing and tooling support.

This layered architecture empowers backend developers and frontend teams to work independently yet cohesively — without sacrificing performance, maintainability, or code quality.
